## Features

- üîí **Security-First Approach**: Keep your DOT staked while participating in governance 
- üó≥Ô∏è **Governance Proxy Management**: Create and manage proxies specifically for OpenGov voting
- üíº **Ledger Hardware Support**: Connect your Ledger device for maximum security
- üåê **Self-Hosting Capabilities**: Deploy your own instance for maximum privacy and control
- üìä **Referenda Overview**: View and interact with ongoing referenda
- üìú **Transaction History**: Track your proxy creations and governance votes

## Why Use DOT Proxy Gov?

DOT Proxy Gov enables you to participate in the Polkadot governance system without needing to unstake your DOT or move funds from cold storage, enhancing both your security and governance participation.

With governance proxies, you can:
- Keep your main DOT holdings secure in cold storage or staked
- Vote on referenda through a proxy wallet with limited permissions
- Use different devices for governance without exposing your main keys
- Manage multiple proxy relationships from a single interface

## Self-Hosting Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dot-proxy-gov.git
cd dot-proxy-gov
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Production Deployment

You can easily deploy this application to Vercel, Netlify, or any other Next.js-compatible hosting platform.

## Using a Custom RPC Node

For better privacy, you can connect to your own Polkadot RPC node by:

1. Adding a `?rpc=wss://your-node-url.com` parameter to the URL
2. Editing the `papi-config.ts` file to change the default endpoints

## Ledger Device Usage

To use your Ledger device with DOT Proxy Gov:

1. Make sure the latest version of the Polkadot (DOT) app is installed on your Ledger
2. Ensure Ledger Live is closed, as it may interfere with the connection
3. Use Chrome or Brave browsers for the best compatibility
4. Connect via a compatible wallet (Talisman recommended) or directly to Polkadot.js

## Security Considerations

- Governance proxies can only perform governance actions, not transfer funds
- Always verify transaction details on your Ledger device screen
- Only add proxy accounts that you fully control or trust
- Consider running your own RPC node for maximum privacy
