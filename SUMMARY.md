# DOT Proxy Gov - Implementation Summary

## Project Structure

We've successfully reorganized the project into a monorepo with the following structure:

```

│   │   ├── components/     # UI components

├── docker-compose.yml      # Docker setup for the entire stack 
└── package.json            # Root package.json for managing the monorepo
```

## Key Features

### 1. Live Governance Data Integration

- Created a Subsquid indexer that tracks on-chain governance proposals and votes
- Integrated real-time data fetching into the UI via GraphQL
- Enhanced the governance proxy provider to query data from the squid API

### 2. Multisig Support (from Multix)

- Integrated multisig account creation functionality based on Multix
- Added a dedicated tab in the UI for multisig management
- Set up the database schema to track multisig accounts and operations

### 3. Comprehensive Docker Setup

- Created a Docker Compose configuration to run:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Squid processor
  - GraphQL server
  - Next.js frontend
- Built deployment and development workflows for local and production environments

### 4. Enhanced User Interface

- Added tabs for Proxies, Referenda, Multisig, and History
- Created clear workflows for proxy and multisig operations
- Built informational components and guides for new users

## Integration with Multix

We've taken several key components from Multix:

1. **Database Schema** - Adapted the Multix schema for:
   - Multisig accounts and signatories
   - Proxy relationships
   - Transaction tracking

2. **UI Components** - Leveraged patterns from Multix for:
   - Multisig account creation
   - Signatory management 
   - Transaction processing

3. **Event Processing** - Adapted the Multix event handling approach for:
   - Tracking proxy creation/removal
   - Recording multisig operations
   - Monitoring governance interactions

## Running the Application

The application can be run in three ways:

1. **Development Mode**:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run docker:up      # Starts database and indexer
   npm run dev:ui         # Starts Next.js development server
   ```

2. **Docker Compose** (full stack):
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Deploy the UI to Vercel, Netlify, etc.
   - Deploy the squid to a VPS or cloud provider
   - Configure the environment variables to connect them

## Future Work

1. **Enhanced Multisig Features**
   - Transaction creation and approval workflows
   - Multisig proposal tracking
   - Support for multisig governance voting

2. **Advanced Governance Features**
   - Detailed referendum analytics
   - Vote delegation
   - Delegation portfolios for track-specific voting

3. **Integration Improvements**
   - Real-time notifications for governance events
   - Integration with Polkadot.js Wallet and Talisman
   - Mobile-optimized interface
